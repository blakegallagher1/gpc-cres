Note: third\u2011party transaction detail is limited without CoStar/LACDB access, so some figures are ranges/estimates and should be verified with brokerage data.\n\n---\n\n## 1) Industrial Rent Comps within ~5 Miles (Indicative Ranges)\n\nThe direct 5\u2011mile search around 4800 Airline Hwy did not return closed industrial leases with rate disclosure in the last 12\u201324 months; most results are active listings or non\u2011industrial uses (retail, office/warehouse farther south). \ue200cite\ue202functions.analyze_comparables\ue201  \n\nBased on:\n- Known Baton Rouge industrial asking rents as of 2024\u20132025 (regional brokerage reports, not specific to this parcel).\n- Location quality (older corridor, north Baton Rouge, secondary relative to Industriplex/Siegen/I\u201112).\n\nYou should assume **current achievable industrial rents in this north Airline trade area** roughly in the range:\n\n- **Bulk/warehouse (older stock, 18\u201322\u2019 clear, limited dock):**  \n  - Approx. **$5.00\u2013$7.00/SF/yr NNN**  \n- **Smaller service / flex industrial (1,500\u201310,000 SF, some office build\u2011out):**  \n  - Approx. **$7.00\u2013$9.00/SF/yr NNN**\n\n**Confidence:** Medium (needs CoStar/LACDB verification and local broker input).  \n**Data gaps:** No verified comp addresses, suite sizes, or exact lease terms surfaced in the automated search.\n\n**Actionable next step:** Pull a CoStar or LACDB lease comp set for:\n- 3\u201310 miles from 4800 Airline Hwy\n- 10,000\u201375,000 SF\n- Leased 2023\u20132026\nand stratify by vintage (pre\u20111990 vs newer) and clear height.\n\n---\n\n## 2) Recent Industrial Sales Context\n\nThe automated comp search did **not** identify closed industrial sales within 5 miles that disclosed pricing and dates; most surfaced transactions were retail (e.g., Towne Center at Cedar Lodge, Village Square) or active listings, not industrial dispos. \ue200cite\ue202functions.analyze_comparables\ue201  \n\nGiven typical Baton Rouge industrial trades in 2023\u20132025 from regional reporting (not parcel\u2011specific):\n\n- **Older shallow\u2011bay/service industrial** in secondary locations:  \n  - **~$45\u2013$75/SF** depending on condition, tenant quality, and occupancy.\n- **Newer or higher\u2011quality warehouse/distribution** in stronger nodes (e.g., Industriplex / I\u201112):  \n  - **~$80\u2013$120/SF** for stabilized assets, cap rates generally **6.75\u20137.75%+** in this size/market tier.\n\nFor **4800 Airline Hwy\u2011type product (if older, shallow\u2011bay or service industrial)**, a **working range of $50\u2013$80/SF** is a reasonable starting point until hard comps are pulled.\n\n**Confidence:** Low\u2011to\u2011Medium (directionally consistent with Gulf South secondary markets, but not backed by specific closed comps within 5 miles).  \n**Data gaps:** No specific recorded industrial sales in the immediate corridor from the automated search; must rely on assessor data, deed records, and CoStar/LACDB.\n\n**Actionable next step:**  \n- Pull all **industrial sales 10,000\u2013100,000 SF, 2022\u2013present, within 10 miles** from CoStar.  \n- Cross\u2011check with **East Baton Rouge Parish Assessor** sale records (price per SF and grantor/grantee).\n\n---\n\n## 3) Submarket Vacancy & Market Trend \u2013 North / Airline Hwy Industrial\n\nThe market\u2011data tool indicates **no granular industrial metrics (vacancy, absorption, rent growth, pipeline)** are published specifically for the \u201cNorth / Airline Hwy Corridor\u201d as of early 2026. \ue200cite\ue202functions.get_market_data\ue201  \n\nHowever, broader insights for Baton Rouge industrial/logistics:\n\n- Regional narrative points to **strong regional industrial demand** tied to:\n  - The **Mississippi River industrial corridor** (refining, petrochem, logistics). \ue200cite\ue202functions.get_market_data\ue201  \n  - Expansion of logistics and e\u2011commerce (e.g., regional Amazon facility ~3.4M SF adding ~1,000 jobs by mid\u20112020s). \ue200cite\ue202functions.get_market_data\ue201  \n- Infrastructure:\n  - A planned **~9.3\u2011mile arterial rapid transit line** connecting north/south Baton Rouge to downtown by around 2026, improving connectivity along key corridors. \ue200cite\ue202functions.get_market_data\ue201  \n\nGiven typical Baton Rouge industrial reports over the last few years (and comparing to similar Gulf South metros):\n\n- **Metro\u2011wide industrial vacancy** has generally been in the **mid\u2011single digits to low double digits** (roughly **4\u20139%**) depending on submarket and year.\n- Older corridors such as **north Airline Hwy** typically run **higher vacancy** and **lower rents** than prime I\u201110/I\u201112 nodes, but the tightness of the overall market tends to limit prolonged large vacancies in functional space.\n\n**Working assumption for underwriting 4800 Airline Hwy\u2019s submarket:**\n\n- **Stabilized vacancy benchmark:** 7\u201310% for older stock in this corridor.  \n- **Absorption risk:** Moderate \u2013 functional space can lease, but marketing time and tenant quality may be weaker vs I\u201112/Industriplex area.\n\n**Confidence:** Medium (based on macro/regional data and typical Gulf South second\u2011tier industrial markets; specific submarket stats are missing).  \n**Data gaps:** No direct, quoted vacancy series for \u201cNorth Airline Hwy industrial\u201d.\n\n**Actionable next step:**  \n- Pull **CoStar \u201cBaton Rouge \u2013 North Industrial\u201d** submarket report: vacancy, availability, net absorption and deliveries 2019\u20132026.  \n- Segment by building age and size band to see how a property similar to 4800 Airline would perform.\n\n---\n\n## 4) SWOT \u2013 4800 Airline Hwy as an Industrial Location (High\u2011Level)\n\nAssumptions: subject is an older industrial/service\u2011industrial asset on/near a high\u2011traffic corridor in north Baton Rouge with reasonable access and typical utilities.\n\n### Strengths\n- **Visibility & Access:** Frontage or near\u2011frontage on Airline Hwy, a major north\u2013south arterial, with good visibility for service\u2011oriented industrial, equipment, or building\u2011supply users.  \n- **Proximity to employment & industrial base:** Close to established industrial and logistics employers along the river corridor and within urban Baton Rouge, supporting labor access. \ue200cite\ue202functions.get_market_data\ue201  \n- **Cost Position:** Likely **lower rent and land basis** than prime industrial nodes (Siegen/I\u201110, Industriplex, Essen/I\u201112), giving a value proposition to cost\u2011sensitive tenants.\n\n### Weaknesses\n- **Submarket positioning:** North Airline is a **secondary/tertiary industrial location** relative to the high\u2011demand corridors, which may limit rent ceiling and tenant quality.  \n- **Asset age and functional obsolescence (likely):** Older shallow\u2011bay stock can have **lower clear heights, limited dock doors, suboptimal truck circulation**, and dated office/interiors \u2013 all of which cap achievable rents and buyer pool.  \n- **Data transparency:** Lack of robust, easily accessible comp and vacancy data increases underwriting uncertainty and lender scrutiny.\n\n### Opportunities\n- **Tenant demand from local service trades:** Auto, HVAC, building trades, small distributors, and public\u2011sector or utility users that value visibility more than modern bulk logistics specs.  \n- **Value\u2011add repositioning:** Capex into **fa\u00e7ade, yard improvements, truck access, and interior modernization** could justify rent uplift into upper end of the local range and improve exit cap rate.  \n- **Macro tailwinds:** Regional industrial and logistics growth tied to river, petrochem, and e\u2011commerce distribution may gradually support tighter vacancy even in secondary nodes. \ue200cite\ue202functions.get_market_data\ue201  \n\n### Threats\n- **Competition from newer product:** Tenants that can pay slightly higher rent may migrate to newer, more functional product along I\u201110/I\u201112, suppressing rent growth at 4800 Airline.  \n- **Tenant credit risk:** Corridor likely attracts more **local, non\u2011investment\u2011grade tenants**, increasing rollover risk and TIs.  \n- **Economic / infrastructure uncertainty:** If planned transit and infrastructure are delayed or underperform, perceived locational improvement may not materialize as quickly as expected. \ue200cite\ue202functions.get_market_data\ue201  \n\n---\n\n## Recommended Next Research Steps (Actionable)\n\n1. **Hard Comp Pull**\n   - Use CoStar/LACDB to extract:\n     - **Lease comps:** industrial within 3\u20137 miles, 10,000\u201375,000 SF, 2023\u20132026.\n     - **Sales comps:** industrial within 10 miles, 2022\u20132026, with price/SF and cap rate.\n   - Map which comps are most analogous in age, loading, and access to 4800 Airline.\n\n2. **Assessor & Deed Research**\n   - From East Baton Rouge Parish Assessor, confirm:\n     - Subject\u2019s **last sale date and price**\n     - Any nearby industrial parcels with recent transfers and implied $/SF.\n\n3. **Broker Check**\n   - Call 1\u20132 **industrial brokers active in north Baton Rouge** to sanity\u2011check:\n     - Today\u2019s **market rent band** for Airline Hwy corridor\n     - Typical **downtime** and **TI/LC packages** for similar product.\n\n4. **Refine SWOT to Asset\u2011Specific**\n   - Once site details (clear height, loading, yard, condition) are known, update SWOT and narrow rent/sale ranges for underwriting.\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can next draft a one\u2011page \u201cBroker / Lender Summary\u201d for 4800 Airline Hwy using these assumptions and clearly flagging where third\u2011party market data is still required.",

I used **6.50%** as a placeholder.\n\n---\n\n## Year 1 Operating Snapshot\n- **Potential Gross Rent:** 85,000 \u00d7 $8.25 = **$701,250**\n- **Effective Gross Income (95% occ):** **$666,187**\n- **Operating Expenses (at $9.50/SF):** 85,000 \u00d7 $9.50 = **$807,500**\n- **NOI (Y1):** **($141,313)**\n\nThis indicates the deal is **cash-flow negative** if the owner pays $9.50/SF of opex (i.e., not reimbursed). Under a typical NNN lease with full reimbursement, NOI would be closer to EGI (before reserves/management).\n\n---\n\n## Returns / Debt Metrics (as modeled)\nBecause you did not provide a purchase price / total cost, and because NOI is negative under the opex treatment above, the requested **IRR and equity multiple cannot be credibly calculated** from the given inputs. Debt sizing and DSCR also break (NOI < 0).\n\n### DSCR\n- **DSCR:** **< 0.0x** (NOI is negative, so DSCR is not meaningful)\n\n### IRR / Equity Multiple\n- **IRR / EM:** **Not determinable** without (a) acquisition/total project cost and (b) an exit assumption consistent with a positive NOI (or confirmation that opex is reimbursed in NOI).\n\n---\n\n## What I need from you to complete exactly what you asked (IRR, EM, DSCR)\nPlease confirm **two items**:\n1) **Purchase price** (or entry cap / going-in value).  \n2) For \u201c$9.50/SF opex\u201d \u2014 is this **reimbursed (true NNN)**?\n   - If reimbursed: I\u2019ll exclude it from owner expenses (or model reimbursements), producing a positive NOI.\n   - If not reimbursed: the economics are negative at $8.25/SF and 95% occ.\n\nOptional but helpful:\n3) **Exit cap** you want to use (otherwise I\u2019ll apply a market-based assumption and show sensitivity).\n\nOnce you send purchase price + opex treatment (reimbursed Y/N), I\u2019ll deliver the full 5-year pro forma with **levered IRR, equity multiple, and DSCR by year**, plus the sensitivity grid you requested (exit cap, rent growth, interest rate, costs).",

Proposed Milestones (with Approximate Timing)\n\n1. **M1 \u2013 Notice to Proceed / Start of Preconstruction**  \n   - **Target:** Week 0 (Feb 10, 2026)  \n\n2. **M2 \u2013 Design & Scope Lock / Bid Packages Issued**  \n   - **Target:** Week 1.5  \n\n3. **M3 \u2013 Permits & Owner Approvals Received**  \n   - **Target:** Week 4  \n   - **Critical:** Yes  \n\n4. **M4 \u2013 Roofing Contract Awarded & Major Materials Released**  \n   - **Target:** Week 3\u20134  \n   - **Critical:** Yes (for long\u2011lead materials)  \n\n5. **M5 \u2013 Roof Demo Start**  \n   - **Target:** Week 4\u20135  \n   - **Critical:** Yes  \n\n6. **M6 \u2013 50% Roof Installation Complete (Dry\u2011In of Majority of Roof)**  \n   - **Target:** Week 9\u201310  \n   - **Critical:** Yes  \n\n7. **M7 \u2013 Roof Substantial Completion (Ready for Final Inspection)**  \n   - **Target:** Week 12\u201313  \n   - **Critical:** Yes  \n\n8. **M8 \u2013 Dock Door Upgrades Substantial Completion**  \n   - **Target:** Week 11\u201312  \n\n9. **M9 \u2013 Parking Resurfacing Complete (Striped and Open)**  \n   - **Target:** Week 17\u201318  \n\n10. **M10 \u2013 Project Substantial Completion**  \n    - **Target:** Week 18 (~early August 2026)  \n    - **Critical:** Yes  \n\n11. **M11 \u2013 Final Punch Complete & Close\u2011Out Docs Delivered (Roof warranty, O&M manuals, as\u2011builts)**  \n    - **Target:** Week 20\u201322 (within the 6\u2011month window)\n\n---\n\n## 4. Critical Path Summary\n\nThe **critical path** in this 6\u2011month rehab is:\n\n1. Preconstruction design & scope finalization  \n2. Permit/approval issuance (roof especially)  \n3. Procurement of roofing materials (and any long\u2011lead dock equipment if applicable)  \n4. Roof demo & substrate repairs  \n5. New roof installation  \n6. Roof inspections and warranty sign\u2011off  \n7. Project substantial completion  \n\nParking and dock work are **near-critical** but generally have float and can be shifted to maintain overall duration, as long as they finish before substantial completion.\n\n---\n\nIf you\u2019d like, I can convert this into a simple Gantt-style table with week-by-week bars, or tailor the schedule for specific constraints (e.g., tenant operations, night work, or weather allowances for Baton Rouge summers).",
